Nine Men's Morris
=================

C# implementation of the classic strategy board game, Nine Men's Morris, known as Nine Man Morris, Mill, Mills, The Mill Game, Merels, Merrills, Merelles, Marelles, Morelles and Ninepenny Marl. 

This is my first C# project. Some fragments (probably the entire thing) _might_ be bad. I created this in about an hour for a school project.
